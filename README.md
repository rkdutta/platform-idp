> **Note — Ingress Controller**: The ingress manifests in this module use **ingress-nginx**, the same Nginx ingress controller installed by the Terraform setup in `setup/terraform/idp-ingress.tf`. If you are using `kubectl port-forward` to access services (which most students do), the ingress controller is not involved — port-forward bypasses ingress entirely. The ingress manifests with `*.127.0.0.1.sslip.io` host rules are provided for students who want to experiment with host-based routing.

---

### 4. ☸️ Teams Operator (`teams-operator/`)
**Duration**: ~20-30 minutes
**Technology**: Python, Kubernetes Python Client

The Teams Operator is a custom Kubernetes controller that watches the Teams API and automatically manages Kubernetes namespaces based on team state. When a team is created via the API (or CLI or UI), the operator detects it and provisions a dedicated namespace. When a team is deleted, the operator cleans up the namespace.

**What You'll Build**:
- A polling-based Kubernetes operator that reconciles team state
- Automated namespace provisioning with proper labels and annotations
- RBAC configuration for operator permissions
- Production-ready container deployment with security hardening

**How It Works**:
1. The operator polls the Teams API every 30 seconds (configurable via `POLL_INTERVAL`)
2. It compares the current list of teams against its known state
3. For new teams, it creates a namespace named `team-<sanitized-team-name>` with metadata labels
4. For deleted teams, it removes the corresponding namespace
5. Each namespace is labeled with `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: teams-operator` and the team ID

#### Step 1: Build the Operator Image

```bash
cd teams-operator

# Build the Docker image
docker build -f operator.Dockerfile -t teams-operator:local .

# Load the image into your kind cluster so nodes can pull it
kind load docker-image teams-operator:local --name 5min-idp
```

> **Note**: The `kind load` step is required because kind clusters cannot pull from your local Docker daemon directly. Without this step, the pod will fail with an `ErrImagePull` error.

#### Step 2: Update the Deployment Image Reference

Before deploying, update `operator-deployment.yaml` to use your locally built image instead of the remote registry image:

```yaml
# In operator-deployment.yaml, change the image field:
image: teams-operator:local
imagePullPolicy: Never   # Add this line — tells Kubernetes not to try pulling from a remote registry
```

#### Step 3: Deploy the Operator

The `operator-deployment.yaml` contains all the Kubernetes resources the operator needs: a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, and Deployment.

```bash
# Apply the operator manifests (creates RBAC, namespace, and deployment)
kubectl apply -f operator-deployment.yaml

# Verify the operator pod is running
kubectl get pods -n engineering-platform -l app=teams-operator

# Expected output:
# NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# teams-operator-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

#### Step 4: Verify Reconciliation

```bash
# Watch the operator logs to see it polling and reconciling
kubectl logs -f deployment/teams-operator -n engineering-platform

# You should see output like:
# Teams Operator starting...
# Teams API URL: http://teams-api-service.engineering-platform.svc.cluster.local:4200
# Poll interval: 30 seconds

# Now create a team via the API (in a separate terminal)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/teams" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Platform Team"}'

# After the next poll cycle (up to 30 seconds), the operator log should show:
# ✅ Created namespace 'team-platform-team' for team 'Platform Team'

# Verify the namespace was created
kubectl get namespace team-platform-team --show-labels
```

#### Step 5: Test Deletion Reconciliation

```bash
# Delete the team via the API
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/teams/<team-id>"

# After the next poll cycle, the operator should remove the namespace
# Check operator logs for:
# 🗑️ Deleted namespace 'team-platform-team' for removed team

# Verify the namespace is gone
kubectl get namespaces | grep team-
```

#### Operator Troubleshooting

**Operator pod is in CrashLoopBackOff:**
```bash
# Check the logs for the error
kubectl logs deployment/teams-operator -n engineering-platform --previous

# Common causes:
# - Teams API not reachable (check TEAMS_API_URL env var and verify the API service is running)
# - RBAC permissions missing (check that the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding were applied)
# - Image not loaded into kind (re-run: kind load docker-image teams-operator:local --name 5min-idp)
```

**Operator running but not creating namespaces:**
```bash
# Check the API URL the operator is using
kubectl get deployment teams-operator -n engineering-platform -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Verify the Teams API is reachable from inside the cluster
kubectl run test-curl --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl -- curl http://teams-api-service.engineering-platform.svc.cluster.local:4200/teams

# Check if RBAC is correct
kubectl auth can-i create namespaces --as=system:serviceaccount:engineering-platform:teams-operator
```

**Path**: [`./teams-operator/`](./teams-operator/)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Recommended Learning Path

Follow this sequence for the best learning experience:

**Step 1: Deploy the Teams API** (Start Here)
```bash
cd teams-api
# Follow the teams-api/README.md guide
```

**Step 2: Set up the CLI Tool**
```bash
cd cli
# Follow the cli/README.md guide
```

**Step 3: Deploy the Web UI**
```bash
cd teams-app
# Follow the teams-app/README.md guide
```

**Step 4: Deploy the Kubernetes Operator**
```bash

# Follow the operator installation steps in this README (Section 4 above)
```

### Alternative: Deploy Everything at Once

For experienced users who want to see the complete stack:

```bash
# Deploy all components in sequence
kubectl apply -f teams-api/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f teams-app/k8s/

# Set up CLI tool
cd cli
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x teams_cli.py

# Verify everything is working
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep teams
```

## 🧪 End-to-End Testing Workflow

Once all components are deployed, test the complete workflow:

> **Important**: The Teams API uses **in-memory storage**. All team data is lost when the API pod restarts. This is intentional for the workshop. If you are working on the capstone and need data to persist across restarts, consider deploying a PostgreSQL or SQLite backend as an extension exercise.

### 1. API Testing
```bash
# Port forward the API (service port 4200 maps to container port 8000)
kubectl port-forward -n teams-api svc/teams-api-service 8080:4200

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/teams" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "TestTeam"}'
```

### 2. CLI Testing
```bash
# Test CLI commands
python cli/teams_cli.py health
python cli/teams_cli.py list
python cli/teams_cli.py create "CLI Test Team"
```

### 3. Web UI Testing
```bash
# Port forward the UI (if using port-forward)
kubectl port-forward -n engineering-platform svc/teams-ui-service 4200:80

# Open browser to http://localhost:4200
# Test creating, viewing, and deleting teams through the interface
```

## 🎯 Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developer Onboarding
```bash
# New developer joins, needs to create a team
python teams_cli.py create "Mobile App Team"

# Verify through web UI
# Add team members through future enhancements
```

### Scenario 2: Automated Team Management
```bash
# CI/CD pipeline creates teams for new projects
#!/bin/bash
for project in "ProjectA" "ProjectB" "ProjectC"; do
    python teams_cli.py create "$project Team"
done

# List current teams
python teams_cli.py list
```

### Scenario 3: Platform Self-Service
```bash
# Teams manage themselves through web interface
# Platform team monitors through API health checks
curl http://teams-api.internal/health

# Grafana dashboards show team creation metrics
# (Future enhancement with monitoring integration)
```
